#goto routes to enter paths

#add crud Article table
resourcess :articles

then to overcome the errors create a articles_controller.rb in controller folder and a articles folder and inside it a new.html.erb file to display whatever u wanna show in that page..
#in the display page there should a form_for in a do block to dsiplay the labels and the coressponding field using the parameters of Article

also include f.submit to make a submit button which will direct to create action in ArticlesController.rb file

but as of now it will not render anything after creating new @article because he havent defined what to show after creating a new article instance.

so we need to add def show in artcile_controller...but, nonetheless, in the db the new instance of article is already created
